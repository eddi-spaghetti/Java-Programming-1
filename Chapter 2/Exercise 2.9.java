/* Chapter 2 Exercise 2.9 (Physics: Acceleration)

*	Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time taken to make 
*	the change, as given by the following formula: a = (v1 â€“ v0)/t

*	Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/second, 
*	the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds, then displays the 
*	average acceleration.
