/* Chapter 2 Exercise 2.10 (Science: Calculating Energy)

*	Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature
*	to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in 
*	kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the 
*	energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184

*	Where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in degrees
*	Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
